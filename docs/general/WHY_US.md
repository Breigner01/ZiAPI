# Why choose ZIAPI

## Modules

First of all **ZIAPI** offers a great deal of simplicity. Modules are separated into clearly defined groups (**network**, **pre-processor**, **post-processor**, **network**) and feature a wide variety of use cases.

Our best selling point is the long list of **example modules** that we have already implemented to help you understand our API better.

Here is a list of non-hexaustive list of modules you can very easily implement using **ZIAPI**.
- Directory Listing
- Authentication
- Automatic MIME type detection
- Routing
- Redirection
- Secure connection module
- PHP CGI
- HTTP Handler

- Benchmark
- Dashboard (frequency of requests, CPU load)
- Logger
- Compression / decompression
